WP CLI wrapper for [spatie/image-optimizer](https://github.com/spatie/image-optimizer). **Optimizing PNGs, JPGs, SVGs and GIFs by running them through a chain of various image [optimization tools](#optimization-tools).** Check this project's [introductory blog post](https://typist.tech/articles/easily-optimize-wordpress-images-using-wp-cli-and-some-binaries/) about why I built it.


## Usage

```bash
# optimize specific attachments
$ wp image-optimize attachment 123 223 323

# optimize certain number of attachments
$ wp image-optimize batch --limit=20

# restore the full sized images of specific attachments
$ wp image-optimize restore 123 223 323
$ wp media regenerate 123 223 323

# restore all full sized images and drop all meta flags
$ wp image-optimize reset
$ wp media regenerate

# Find and optimize images under a given directory **without backup**
$ wp image-optimize find /path/to/my/directory --extensions=gif,jpeg,jpg,png,svg

# shortcusts for `wp image-optimize find` **without backup**
$ wp image-optimize mu-plugins
$ wp image-optimize plugins
$ wp image-optimize themes
$ wp image-optimize wp-admin
$ wp image-optimize wp-includes

# learn more
$ wp help image-optimize
$ wp help image-optimize <subcommand>
```

## Installing

Installing this package requires [WP-CLI v2.0.0](https://wp-cli.org/) or greater. Update to the latest stable release with `wp cli update`.

Once you've done so, you can install this package with:

```bash
$ wp package install typisttech/image-optimize-command:@stable
```

### Optimization tools

Under the hood, `image-optimize-command` invokes [spatie/image-optimizer](https://github.com/spatie/image-optimizer) which requires these binaries installed:

- [JpegOptim](http://freecode.com/projects/jpegoptim)
- [Optipng](http://optipng.sourceforge.net/)
- [Pngquant 2](https://pngquant.org/)
- [SVGO](https://github.com/svg/svgo)
- [Gifsicle](http://www.lcdf.org/gifsicle/)

Check spatie/image-optimizer's readme for [install instructions](https://github.com/spatie/image-optimizer#optimization-tools).

Note that [WordPress doesn't support SVG](https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/24251) out of the box. You can omit [SVGO](https://github.com/svg/svgo).
However, if you have [enabled WordPress SVG support](https://kinsta.com/blog/wordpress-svg/?kaid=CGCHYHJJJMMF) and uploaded SVGs to WordPress media library, you must install SVGO. Otherwise, the command will fail.

## Use Cases

### First use

This command optimize both the full sized image(the one you uploaded) and the thumbnails(WordPress auto-resize these images for you).

Chances are the thumbnails are missing or never generated:

- theme switched after upload
- plugins activated after upload
- deleted the images from disk but not updated WordPress' database

Simplest solution is to regenerate thumbnails then optimize:

```bash
$ wp media regenerate
$ wp image-optimize batch --limit=9999999

$ wp image-optimize mu-plugins
$ wp image-optimize plugins
$ wp image-optimize themes
$ wp image-optimize wp-admin
$ wp image-optimize wp-includes
```

### After upgrading WordPress core / plugins / themes

```bash
$ wp image-optimize mu-plugins
$ wp image-optimize plugins
$ wp image-optimize themes
$ wp image-optimize wp-admin
$ wp image-optimize wp-includes
```

### Restoring the originals

This command backs up the full sized images before optimizing attachments, use `--skip-backup` to skip backup file generation (WARNING: with `--skip-backup` the original images will be gone forever). If you want to restore them:

```bash
# optimize **with backup**
$ wp image-optimize attachment 123
# optimize **without backup**
$ wp image-optimize attachment 123 --skip-backup

# restore the full sized image
$ wp image-optimize restore 123
# regenerate the thumbnails from the original full sized image
$ wp media regenerate 123
```

### Migrating from image-optimize-command v0.1.x

Starting from v0.2, this command backs up the full sized images before optimizing attachments. To migrate from image-optimize-command v0.1.x:

```bash
$ wp image-optimize reset
$ wp media regenerate
$ wp image-optimize batch --limit=9999999
```

## FAQs

### What kind of optimization it does?

Mostly applying compression, removing metadata and reducing the number of colors to PNGs, JPGs, SVGs and GIFs. The package is smart enough pick the right tool for the right image.

Check Freek Van der Herten's [article](https://murze.be/easily-optimize-images-using-php-and-some-binaries) explaining `spatie/image-optimizer`'s [*sane default configuration*](https://github.com/spatie/image-optimizer/blob/124da0d/src/OptimizerChainFactory.php).

### Can I customize the optimization?

Yes.

```php
use Spatie\ImageOptimizer\OptimizerChain;

add_filter('typist_tech_image_optimized_optimizer_chain', function (OptimizerChain $optimizerChain): OptimizerChain {
    // Option A: Send messages to $optimizerChain.
    $optimizerChain->setTimeout($xxx);
    $optimizerChain->useLogger($yyy);
    $optimizerChain->addOptimizer($zzz);

    // Option B: Make a new $optimizerChain.
    // See: https://github.com/spatie/image-optimizer/blob/master/src/OptimizerChainFactory.php
    $optimizerChain = new OptimizerChain();
    $optimizerChain->addOptimizer($zzz);

    // Finally
    return $optimizerChain;
});
```

### Does running `wp image-optimize attachment / batch` multiple times trigger multiple optimization for the same attachments?

No.

By default, boolean flags (meta fields) are given to attachments after optimization. This is to prevent re-optimizing an already optimized attachment. If you changed the image files (e.g.: resize / regenerate thumbnail), you must first reset their meta flags.

Note: The `find` subcommand and its shortcuts don't create meta flags.

### Will the images look different after optimization?

Yes, a little bit. This is lossy optimization. However, you won't notice the difference unless you have a trained eye for that.

See [spatie/image-optimizer](https://github.com/spatie/image-optimizer#which-tools-will-do-what)'s readme on binary options used.

### Why my GIFs stopped animating?

> When you upload an image using the media uploader, WordPress automatically creates several copies of that image in different sizes...When creating new image sizes for animated GIFs, **WordPress ends up saving only the first frame of the GIF**...
>
> --- [wpbeginner](http://www.wpbeginner.com/wp-tutorials/how-to-add-animated-gifs-in-wordpress/)

Luckily for you, Lasse M. Tvedt showed how to stop WordPress from resizing GIFs on [StackExchange](https://wordpress.stackexchange.com/a/229724).

### Can I use this on managed hosting?

No, you can't use this on managed hosting such as [Kinsta](http://bit.ly/kinsta-com) or [WP Engine](https://typist.tech/go/wp-engine) because they don't allow you to install those binaries.

If you must use it on managed hosting, [hire a developer](https://typist.tech/contact/) to add SaaS provider integration:

- [EWWW](https://typist.tech/go/ewww/)
- [Kraken](https://typist.tech/go/kraken/)
- [ImageOptim](https://typist.tech/go/imageoptim-api/)
- [Imagify](https://typist.tech/go/imagify/)


### Do I have to install `SVGO`?

Yes, if you have:

- [enabled WordPress SVG support](https://kinsta.com/blog/wordpress-svg/?kaid=CGCHYHJJJMMF)
- uploaded SVGs to WordPress media library
- using the `find` subcommand (or its shortcuts) with `--extensions=svg`

No, if you don't have any SVGs in WordPress media library.

### `PHP Fatal error: Allowed memory size of 999999 bytes exhausted (tried to allocate 99 bytes)`

This is a common WP CLI issue. See: [https://bit.ly/wpclimem](https://make.wordpress.org/cli/handbook/common-issues/#php-fatal-error-allowed-memory-size-of-999999-bytes-exhausted-tried-to-allocate-99-bytes)

### Does it have a limits or quotas?

No, unlike other SaaS alternatives, this package runs on your server without any limitation on file sizes or a monthly quota. Totally free of charge.

### Will you add support for older PHP versions?

Never! This package will only works on [actively supported PHP versions](https://secure.php.net/supported-versions.php).

Don't use it on **end of life** or **security fixes only** PHP versions.

### Is it for everyone?

No, it comes at a cost. Optimization is CPU intensive. Expect CPU usage rockets up to 100% during optimization. Schedule it to run at late night in small batches.
